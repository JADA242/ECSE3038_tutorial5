# ESP32 Weather API Project  

## Overview  
This project fetches real-time weather data from an API and controls an LED based on rainfall. It is designed to run on an ESP32 microcontroller and can be tested using Wokwi, an online ESP32 simulator.  

## Features  
- Fetches weather data from an API, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, and cloud coverage  
- Prints JSON response to the Serial Monitor for debugging and monitoring  
- Turns the LED on when rainfall is above zero millimeters and off otherwise
